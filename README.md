+ Camera pathing simplified. No more camera lurch at high speeds!
+ Added a swing platform to the left room for physics testing (and shenanigans)

### DEMO-v1.0
First public build released! This is meant to be a playable demo for the physics system, along with some basic level geometry to play around with and get a feel for the controls! The left and right rooms contain some test assets originally meant for tinkering with Unity's 2D effector components. These will like be removed in future updates.
